# react_NLW_e-sports
project to find a colleague to play with you.
I started by configuring the server, with Prisma and some libraries, we developed the database SQl, geting information of a API 
at "https://www.twitch.tv/", all the components are in React and very well styled  with Tailwind and exported by a styling folder.
